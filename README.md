# Portfolio - Priyanka Mary Christine|Full Stack Web Developer

This is my portfolio website containing samples of my work.

# Features
- The header contains my name and links to 3 sections: About me, My work and Contact me.
- You can scroll to the corresponding section by clicking the links in the navigation.
- The About me section contains my recent photo and a brief introduction.
- My work section contains the titled images of the applications that I have developed. (Since I don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, I have used 'Coming soon' images. I will change them to real applications as I create them later.)
- When you click on the images of the applications, you will be taken to that deployed application.
- My contact section contains my email id, phone number, github profile link and linkedIn profile link.
- When you click on the email id, it will launch your default Email Client with my email address in the 'To' section.
- When you click on the github link or linkedIn link, my github or linkedIn profile URL will be opened in a new tab in the browser.
- When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, then you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.
